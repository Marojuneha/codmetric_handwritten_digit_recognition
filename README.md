# codmetric_handwritten_digit_recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning on the MNIST dataset.  This project builds a simple neural network model with TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits (0–9).The trained model achieves high accuracy (~97–98%) and demonstrates predictions on sample test images.
